JSON is a pure string written in a convention format, which does not have any characteristics of data structure.
Python's dictionary key can be any hash object, and JSON can only be a string.
The Python dict string uses single quotation marks, and JSON enforces double quotation marks. You can nest tuple in Python dict.
